🔍 What It Does:
ReviewPulse is an intelligent sentiment analysis dashboard that aggregates user opinions about any product from multiple sources (start with Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube comments). It then uses NLP models to analyze sentiment, emerging trends, and feature-specific opinions (e.g., battery life, price, camera).

🎯 Real-World Problem It Solves:
Consumers often face information overload when researching products. ReviewPulse offers condensed, trustworthy insights pulled from multiple platforms to support better purchase decisions. Businesses can also monitor brand sentiment or competitor reviews.
